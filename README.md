# Crop Prediction Using KNN

## **Introduction**
Agriculture forms a cornerstone of the Indian economy, and accurate crop prediction is essential for better planning and resource management. This mini-project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** classification algorithm to predict the type of crop grown on a given plot based on real-world agricultural data. The dataset includes factors such as land area, season, sowing and harvesting dates, yield, and crop type, primarily collected from the **Cauvery River region**.

## **Data Source**
The dataset, titled **"Sickle Tabular Dataset"**, is publicly available and derived from government reports and field-level surveys. It contains **structured, labelled agricultural data** for research and academic purposes. This dataset captures detailed seasonal trends and crop diversity in **Tamil Nadu**, particularly within the **Cauvery River basin**.

## **Project Goal**
The main objective is to **classify crop type** based on tabular features using the **KNN algorithm**. The workflow involves:
- **Data exploration & visualization** to understand feature patterns.
- **Feature analysis** for model input optimization.
- **Model development** using KNN classification.
- **Performance evaluation** to measure prediction accuracy.

## **Potential Impact**
This system can be extended into a **decision support tool** for agricultural advisory services. By predicting the most probable crop type for given land and climate conditions, it can help **farmers and planners** make informed decisions, improve resource utilization, and enhance agricultural productivity.
